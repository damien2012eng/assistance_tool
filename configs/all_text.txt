Equipment and Environment Requirements for At Home
Testing
If you’re planning to take the TOEFL iBT Home Edition, review and confirm that you meet these
requirements before registering for a smoother test day experience. If you don't meet these
requirements on test day, you won't be able to test. In that event, you won’t receive a refund or a
free reschedule.
Confirm your computer meets equipment requirements
Download the ETS Secure Browser by selecting one of the links below.
Download the Mac® OS version(https://ibtprod-rp.ets.org/SoftwareDistribution/rp/PROD/mac/ETS-RP-PROD.dmg)
Download the Windows® version(https://ibtprod-rp.ets.org/SoftwareDistribution/rp/UnifyRPInstaller/1.2/UnifyRPInstaller_PROD.exe)
Then run the file to complete the installation. While in the browser, click the Equipment Check
button to confirm that your equipment is ready for test day.
How to run the Equipment Check (with screenshots)

View the screenshots below to learn what you can expect when running the ETS Secure
Browser.
Once you open the ETS Secure Browser, you’ll be brought to this welcome screen. From here,
you can run the Equipment Check.
Upon completion of the Equipment Check, you’ll see the status of your equipment. If any
parts have failed, you’ll see a red triangle status indicator, as well as tips for how to resolve the

problem.
The equipment check includes a bandwidth check. Since bandwidth differs depending on
time of day and network usage, run the equipment check at several different times to see
which time works best. Additionally, you should run the check on the same day of the week
and the same time of day as your test. That way, you're checking your bandwidth in an
environment similar to what you would experience when you test. Watch the helpful Tech Tips
video.
When you have successfully passed the equipment check, you’ll arrive at the Congratulations
page.
If your check fails and you can't resolve the issues yourself, visit Equipment Check Support
for troubleshooting tips.

Identification (ID) Requirements for the TOEFL iBT Test
The name you use when registering
When you create your ETS account and register for your test, it’s important to make sure that the
name you use exactly matches the name on the identification (ID) information you plan to use on the
day of your test. If this information doesn't match, you won't be able to take the test, and your test fee
won't be refunded. If you’re concerned about a discrepancy, contact TOEFL® Services before you
register. TOEFL Services can also help if your name changes after you register.
How to enter your name
The first and last name you use when you register — and the spelling of that name —
must exactly match (excluding accents) the name printed on the ID you’ll present on the
day of your test.
Provide your entire first (given) name (excluding accents). Don’t register under a
nickname or with only an initial as your first name.
Supply your entire last (family/surname) name. If you have a two-part first or last name,
supply your complete last name as it appears on the ID (excluding accents) that you’ll
present on the day of the test. For example, a last name of Fernandez de Córdova would
be entered as Fernandez de Cordova.
You have the option to include your middle initial, but it’s not a requirement.

2/18/25, 2:23 PM ID Requirements for the TOEFL iBT Test
If you register by phone, make sure you’re registered under your entire first and last
names as they appear on your ID (excluding accents).
Already have an account?
If you already have an ETS account, confirm that the name on your ID still matches the name
that appears in your account (excluding accents). If they don’t, contact TOEFL Services.
Your ID requirements
Your ID requirements depend on where you plan to take the test and your citizenship. If testing
at home, you’re required to present valid government-issued ID.
Review the general ID requirements below, then select the country/location where you plan to test to
see specific ID requirements.
General ID document requirements
With few exceptions, ID documents must meet all of the following requirements. Each ID document
must:

be a physical ID; a digital ID issued to a mobile phone or any other electronic device is not
acceptable, except in the Republic of Korea, where some digital IDs are permitted
be a government-issued national/state/province identity card that is issued and recognized by

If you are age 15 or younger when you take the test, we suggest that you be accompanied by a
parent or other authorized adult age 18 or older, who will be required to complete and sign a
release form at the test center.
Both you and the parent or authorized adult must present valid, acceptable ID, or you will not
be able to take the test. If you are unable to meet the ID requirements, contact the Office of
Testing Integrity (OTI) before you register for the test.

Birth certificate

Any temporary ID card
Diplomatic, consulate or embassy ID card
If your ID document is not written in English-language letters and the test center administrator
cannot read it, you may not be able to take the test, and your test fee will not be refunded.
Supplemental ID documents
You might have to provide a supplemental ID document if:
the proctor questions your primary ID document
your primary ID document is otherwise acceptable but is missing your full name,
photograph or signature
You can't use supplemental ID documents to resolve last-name discrepancies; you’ll need
to contact TOEFL Services before test day to resolve.
If you can't provide acceptable supplemental ID (see below) that includes your signature, you
can present two government-issued IDs with photographs, as long as they use the same name
you used when you registered.
Acceptable supplemental ID
The following ID documents are generally acceptable as supplemental ID:
Government-issued ID card (including, but not limited to, those listed under Acceptable
Primary ID Documents)
Student ID card

2/18/25, 2:23 PM ID Requirements for the TOEFL iBT Test
Confirmation of identity letter from your educational institution. This letter must be
typed or printed on the original letterhead of the educational institution you attend(ed)
and, in addition to meeting all of the ID Document Requirements, must include your date
of birth and the date issued. Additionally, a school official's signature and the school seal
must be present and both must overlap your photograph, as shown below. Such letters
are valid for only 1 year from the date issued.
Driver's license renewals
If you are in the U.S. military and the expiration of your driver's license has been
extended or deferred by the issuing state, it can be used as supplemental ID along
with your U.S. military ID card. Depending on the state, the extension or deferral may
consist of a sticker on the license, the designation "military" printed in place of an
expiration date, or a separate document carried with the license, usually with a
notation that the license is valid for a specific amount of time after discharge from
service.
If your driver's license has expired but you present it along with your Original
Department of Public Safety renewal certificate, the two documents together can
be accepted if the names match exactly. If you have a temporary paper license
instead of a renewal certificate, that is acceptable only if it is accompanied by an
acceptable supplemental ID.
Unable to meet ID requirements
If you have been granted political asylum, have refugee status or are otherwise unable to meet
the ID requirements, you must contact the ETS Office of Testing Integrity (OTI) at least 7 days
before you register. You must receive approval from OTI before you register. Be prepared to

When to run your equipment check
You should complete the ETS Secure Browser Equipment Check before your test
appointment to help ensure you’ll have the best at home testing experience.
If possible, you should run the Equipment Check on the same day of the week and at
the same time as your future test appointment to simulate the bandwidth demands
you’ll experience on test day.

Upon completion of the Equipment Check, you’ll see the status of your equipment.
If any parts have failed, you’ll see a red triangle status indicator, as well as tips for
how to resolve the problem.
The equipment check includes a bandwidth check. Since bandwidth differs
depending on time of day and network usage, run the equipment check at several
different times to see which time works best. Additionally, you should run the
check on the same day of the week and the same time of day as your test. That
way, you're checking your bandwidth in an environment similar to what you would
experience when you test.
